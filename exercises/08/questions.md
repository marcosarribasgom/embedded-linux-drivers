# Exercise 08 - Q&A

## 1. What is `uname -a` output on the PYNQ board before starting Ex 8?

## 2. What is the average latency and worst case latency you measure after Ex 7 using the application you developed?

## 3. What is `uname -a` output on the PYNQ board after rebooting with the new kernel image?

## 4. What is the average latency and worst case latency you measure in the new kernel image (same procedure as question 2)?

## 5. Compare the results of questions 2 and 4; do they differ significantly? why?

## 6. Compare the plots for the 6 different profiles. Describe each of them and compare them?

## 7. Document the RT performance differences and their reasons

## 8. What is the goal of this exercise? What did you accomplish?

## 9. Feedback (what was difficult? what was easy? how would you improve it?)
